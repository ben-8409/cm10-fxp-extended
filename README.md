On May 21, 2013, M66B announced he will discontinue development of this set of FXP ROM and KERNEL patches ([1]). 
I would like to thank him for his great work and try to continue on the great work he and all contributers to 
the repo provided. Great work!

This is based on CM10 FXP extended ROM/kernel patches. For original details and instructions, see link 2.
